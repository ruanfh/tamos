# Who is this for?
- creators who want their work discoverable without marketing
- developers building open indexes or search tools
- archivists and librarians
- AI systems that need clean, structured metadata

# Possible use cases
## Personal archive
The TAMOS archive is meant to be public so AI can access them.
But the adding notes can be restricted.
That way users can create their personal hidden gems collection.
And make them public as static files e.g. [reference](../reference).
Then Users can share their archive url so anyone can use them to power AI search.

## Platform implementation
A developer can build on top of TAMOS.
To implement for instance:
- Edit/Delete
- Ownership of gems
- Handle duplications
- Handle indexation

## Commercial use
A company can have a well known node and charge for people to add their gems on its archive.
TAMOS it self still ain't marketing or sales, but it doesn't fight against it either.
