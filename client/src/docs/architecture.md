# TAMOS Client Architecture

The TAMOS Client is a minimal command‑line tool for creating and submitting gems to a TAMOS‑compatible server.
Its purpose is to give humans (and scripts) a simple, predictable way to generate valid gems and send them to a node without needing to craft JSON manually or interact with HTTP directly.
