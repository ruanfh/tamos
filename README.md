# TAMOS

TAMOS is defined by the specification in [protocol/SPEC.md](protocol/SPEC.md).

This repository exists to host:
- The TAMOS protocol specification
- Non-normative reference material and implementations

## Scope

TAMOS is a minimal protocol for publishing small, meaningful resources.

It defines concepts and rules only.

It does not define platforms, services, networks, guarantees, or behavior beyond what is explicitly stated in the specification.

If something is not in the spec, it is not TAMOS.

## Repository

```text
protocol/  -> TAMOS protocol specification (authoritative)
sky/       -> Example TAMOS-Garden (non-normative)
server/    -> Example TAMOS-Archive API implementation
client/    -> Example TAMOS-Archive CLI
docs/      -> Conceptual notes
dev-notes/ -> Drafts and internal material
```

Only `protocol/` is normative.

## Status

Early draft (v0.x).
Expect changes.
