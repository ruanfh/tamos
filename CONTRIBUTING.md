# Contribution Policy

Issues are open for questions, suggestions, and general feedback.

Not all issues will receive a response. Some may be closed without action to
keep the project manageable.

Issues are for discussion only. They do not imply commitments, roadmaps, or
guarantees of change.

Pull requests are not accepted at this time. Development is handled directly by
the project author.

Design feedback and protocol discussion are welcome via issues.
