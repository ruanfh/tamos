# Why TAMOS Exists

Discovering relevant tools, resources, or products on the internet often requires navigating large amounts of unstructured information. While search engines and crawlers can retrieve content efficiently, they primarily operate on raw documents and links, without understanding which resources a person intentionally considers meaningful or worth sharing.

TAMOS exists to provide a minimal, structured way to expose resources for exploration. It allows publishers to explicitly present what they consider relevant, and allows explorers to navigate those resources without relying on implicit signals such as popularity, ranking, or advertising.

TAMOS does not attempt to replace crawling or indexing. Instead, it complements them by introducing explicit structure and intent.

# Why Structure Matters

A URL alone provides access to content, but not context. Without additional structure, each resource is isolated and indistinguishable from any other.

In TAMOS, **Stars** are made discoverable by being placed within a **Sky** and grouped into **Constellations**. This grouping is intentional and explicit:

- **Sky**: Defines the environment in which Stars are exposed for exploration.
- **Constellations**: Group related Stars, providing contextual boundaries.

Together, they transform a collection of independent URLs into an explorable space.

Exploration in TAMOS is not based on ranking or traversal heuristics, but on explicit grouping and exposure defined by the publisher.

# Crawling vs. TAMOS

- **Crawling** reveals what exists.
- **TAMOS** reveals what has been intentionally exposed and how it is grouped.

By separating raw availability from intentional publication, TAMOS enables clearer discovery, simpler exploration, and more predictable behavior for both humans and machines.
