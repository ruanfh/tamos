# Why TAMOS?

TAMOS aims to offer a simple, structured way for publishers to share resources and for explorers to find them, independent of popularity or ranking.

# Structure, Not Just Links

A URL gives access, but not context. TAMOS groups resources into **Skies** and **Constellations**, making collections explorable and meaningful.

---

# Crawling vs. TAMOS

Crawling shows what exists. TAMOS shows what’s intentionally exposed and how it’s organized.

---

# TAMOS and AI

AI can already do the job. TAMOS is designed to offer structured context that may help AI systems better understand what has been intentionally shared and how resources are organized.
