# Why

This section is meant to explore the reasons behind the decisions including why TAMOS even exist.

This document is non-normative.

## Why TAMOS?

TAMOS aims to offer a simple, structured way for publishers to share resources and for explorers to find them, independent of popularity or ranking.

---

## Structure, Not Just Links

A URL gives access, but not context. TAMOS groups resources into **Skies**, making collections explorable and meaningful.

---

## Crawling vs. TAMOS

Crawling shows what exists. TAMOS shows what’s intentionally exposed.

---

## TAMOS and AI

AI can already do the job. TAMOS is designed to offer structured context that may help AI systems better understand what has been intentionally shared and how resources are organized.

## TAMOS Language

TAMOS does sound like a myth rather than a protocol. That is intentional!  
It is meant to make TAMOS concepts more clear through analogy, although these terms are strictly defined.  
TAMOS language also aims to make the concepts more memorable.  
Finally the language avoid confusion with other terms already in use.  

The following explanations are the reasons behind name choices, not their precise definitions.  

### Why Gem?

A gem is a small artifact, usually considered precious but not necessarily practical.  
A gem can be hidden, discovered, and given to others.  
Unlike a physical gem, a digital Gem (a URL and description) can be shared freely without being lost or diminished, this is where the analogy stops.

### Why Star?

A star is an identifiable mark that emits light, making it visible and useful for orientation.  
In TAMOS, a Star is simply a Gem made visible, an intentional point of reference, like a perspective shared with others.  

A star is often associated with fame, but in TAMOS, a Star does not imply popularity, only discoverability. This distinction is important: publishing a Star in TAMOS does not guarantee attention or endorsement. The term Scout reinforces this idea, a Scout is simply someone who discovers and shares a Gem, not a gatekeeper or promoter.

### Why Sky?

The sky contains the stars and makes them accessible for exploration.  
Just as weather can make the sky clear or cloudy, different conditions can affect how visible or accessible Stars are in TAMOS.  
The analogy highlights that a Sky is an environment, sometimes open and discoverable, sometimes hidden or limited, embracing more than just technical availability.  

### Why East-Horizon

The stars are born in the east horizon, marking the transition from hidden to observable. Just like the East-Horizon turns a Gem into a Star.

This image of a gem turning into a star sounds like a myth, this is a feature, not a bug.

### Why West-Horizon

The stars fade into the west horizon, but not all do—some, like the north star, remain visible. In TAMOS, removal is possible but not required; in TAMOS-Archive it's even not allowed. The analogy ends when it comes to replacement actions in the TAMOS-Garden, which have no direct counterpart in the sky.

### Why Constellation

A constellation is an artificial grouping of stars, a pattern assigned by people to create meaning from sets of stars.

Constellations do not contain stars; they connect them, helping explorers and AI agents interpret and discover relationships, just as people have done for centuries.

In TAMOS, Stars belong to a Sky, but can be freely grouped into many Constellations by explorers (mostly AI).

## Questions About TAMOS

### Why not use existing search engines or AI?

TAMOS does not replace automated exploration, in fact it is built precisely to depend on them.

### Why explicit structure and new terms?

- Clarity.
- Easy onboard.
- Memorization.

### Why invest effort in organizing resources?

TAMOS is for any one who wants to try it, it's not meant to appeal to everyone.

Even those who don't want to actively manage structuring may benefit from search using such data.

### Why not rely on popularity or automation?

TAMOS does not forbid platforms to build popularity and automation layers on top of TAMOS.

Platforms may implement on top of TAMOS:
- Automated garbage collection
- Automated Star generation
- Popularity metrics

### Why trust publisher-provided structure?

You don't trust them, the philosophy behind TAMOS is to treat every publishers as independent biased view points.

There is no guarantee of trust implied or expected, that being said, platforms may implement moderation on top of TAMOS.
