# TAMOS Protocol

TAMOS is an append-only, immutable protocol for sharing "gems" (resources) as structured JSON objects. See docs/how.md for details.

- Gems are never edited or deleted, only appended.
- Multiple gems can exist for the same URL.
- Each gem must follow the gem.schema.json definition.
