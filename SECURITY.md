# Security

## Security Status

This project is not security‑audited.
It should be treated as experimental and not hardened for adversarial environments.

## Deployment Warning

Do not expose any reference implementation, server, or tooling from this repository directly to the public internet without an independent security review appropriate to your deployment context.  
TAMOS is a protocol specification.  
Security properties depend entirely on how an implementation is built, deployed, and maintained.

## Expectations

Users and implementers are responsible for:
- Reviewing the code before deployment
- Applying standard operational security practices
- Hardening their environment
- Keeping dependencies updated
