# Why

Finding the right product or tool online is harder than it should be. Search results are dominated by marketing, ads, and popularity; not by what truly fits a person's needs. Meanwhile, many great products remain hidden, overlooked by those who would benefit most.

TAMOS exists to:
- Expose hidden gems to the people who need them, without marketing noise or sales pressure.
- Give creators a fair chance to be discovered, regardless of budget or hype.
- Provide a neutral, open, and structured index—so both people and machines can find products based on intent, values, and real usage.
- Make discovery transparent, description-driven, and accessible, with no rankings or bias.

In short, TAMOS is about connecting the right people to the right tools, in a way that's open, fair, and easy to navigate.


# Why TAMOS Exists Even When Crawling Is Possible

Although any website can be crawled, crawling alone cannot provide the clarity, intent, or structure that TAMOS offers. Crawlers extract raw content, but they cannot reliably determine what a human considers important, meaningful, or worth sharing.

In short, crawling reveals what exists; TAMOS reveals what’s important.
