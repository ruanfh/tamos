# TAMOS

TAMOS is defined by the specification in [protocol/SPEC.md](protocol/SPEC.md).

> Only [protocol/SPEC.md](protocol/SPEC.md) and [protocol/gem.submit.schema.json](protocol/gem.submit.schema.json) are authoritative.

This repository exists to host:
- The TAMOS protocol specification
- Non-normative reference material and implementations

## Scope

TAMOS is a minimal protocol meant for revealing small, meaningful resources for machines to later explore.

It defines concepts and rules only.

It does not define platforms, services, networks, guarantees, or behavior beyond what is explicitly stated in the specification.
