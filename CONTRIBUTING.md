# Contribution Policy

Thanks for your interest in the project!

Issues are open for questions, suggestions, and general feedback. I
appreciate every message, even if I can't respond to all of them. Some
issues may be closed without action, just to keep things manageable on my end.

Pull requests are not accepted at this time. Development is handled
directly by the project author.

Thanks again for taking the time to engage!
