# Who is this for?
- Creators who want their work discoverable without marketing
- Developers building open indexes or search tools
- Archivists and librarians
- AI systems that need clean, structured metadata


# Possible use cases
## Personal private archive
A TAMOS node can be created for private usage if someone runs a local AI LLM.

## Personal public archive
The TAMOS archive may be meant to be public so AI can access it.

Adding notes can be restricted, allowing users to create personal hidden gem collections and make them public as static files (see [reference](../reference) to see an actual example).

Users can share their archive URL so anyone can use it to power AI search.


## Platform implementation
A developer can build on top of TAMOS to implement features such as:
- Edit/Delete (allowed by the protocol, but not required)
- Ownership of gems
- Handling duplications
- Indexation


## Commercial use
A company can operate a well-known Node and charge for people to add their Gems to its Archive. TAMOS itself is not marketing or sales, but does not prohibit commercial use.
