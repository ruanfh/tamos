# Contribution Policy

Thanks for your interest in the project!

Issues are open for questions, suggestions, and general feedback.

I appreciate every message, even if I can’t respond to all of them. Some issues may be closed without action simply to keep things manageable.

Issues are for discussion, not commitments or guarantees of change.

Pull requests are not accepted at this time. Development is handled directly by the project author.

Design feedback and protocol discussions are welcome via issues.

Thanks again for taking the time to engage!
