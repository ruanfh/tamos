# Security

## Security Status

This project is not security‑audited.
It should be treated as experimental and not hardened for adversarial environments.

## Deployment Warning

Do not expose any reference implementation, server, or tooling from this repository directly to the public internet without an independent security review appropriate to your deployment context.  

TAMOS is a protocol specification, not a security boundary.

Security properties depend entirely on how an implementation is built, deployed, and maintained.

Any reference implementation is provided solely for specification clarity and experimentation, not for production use.

## Expectations

Deployers, operators, and implementers are responsible for:
- Reviewing the code before deployment
- Applying standard operational security practices
- Hardening their environment
- Keeping dependencies updated
- Monitoring their deployment for unexpected behavior

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you believe you have found a security issue, please do not open a public issue.
Instead, contact the maintainer privately.

Please use GitHub’s private advisory system for responsible disclosure.
